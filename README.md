![April Speight. Author, developer, style aficionado.](/GitHub-Banner.png)

Hello, I'm April! I came from the fabulous world of luxury fashion where I was both a menswear stylist and visual merchandiser. I later transitioned into the tech industry as a project manager and systems analyst. Earlier in my tech career, I created Python content on Youtube and a variety of written project-based tutorials which later led to my first published title [Bite-Size Python: An Introduction to Python Programming](https://www.wiley.com/Bite+Size+Python%3A+An+Introduction+to+Python+Programming-p-9781119643821). During a delayed flight at LaGuardia, I saw my first HoloLens 2 demo which integrated speech translation in real-time! That moment changed my life as I grew beyond passionate of working with all the various realities. Today, I'm a Sr. Cloud Advocate on the Spatial Computing technical team at Microsoft.
